# SECURITY INCIDENT RECOVERY DOCUMENTATION

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** 28+ hours posting outage due to exposed secrets  

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

### What Happened
Two critical secrets were accidentally exposed in the GitHub repository:
- **JWT token** in commit `ab7774c` 
- **Supabase Service Key** in `.env.production` file (commit `ae95b970`)

### Impact Assessment
- **Duration:** 28+ hours of posting failures
- **Root Cause:** Vercel AUTH_TOKEN was only 36 characters instead of 200+ (invalid JWT)
- **Systems Affected:** All automated posting workflows via GitHub Actions
- **Data Breach:** No user data compromised, only automation credentials exposed

### Detection Method
- GitHub secret scanning detected exposed JWT token
- Manual audit revealed additional Supabase key exposure
- Posting failures were silent (GitHub Actions showed success but API returned 401)

## EXPOSED SECRETS INVENTORY

### 1. JWT Authentication Token
- **Location:** Commit `ab7774c`
- **Type:** JWT Bearer token for API authentication
- **Risk Level:** CRITICAL
- **Used By:** GitHub Actions workflows, API authentication

### 2. Supabase Service Role Key  
- **Location:** `.env.production` (commit `ae95b970`)
- **Type:** Supabase database service key
- **Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
- **Used By:** Database connections, Supabase API calls

### 3. Additional Potentially Exposed Secrets
- Various API keys for social media platforms
- Database connection strings
- Admin passwords

## RECOVERY ACTIONS TAKEN

### PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (URGENT)

#### 1.1 Secret Rotation
```bash
# Generated new secure secrets
npx tsx scripts/rotate-secrets-emergency.ts
```
- ✅ Generated new 256-bit JWT_SECRET
- ✅ Generated new JWT_REFRESH_SECRET  
- ✅ Generated new AUTH_TOKEN (217 chars)
- ✅ Generated new Supabase service key

#### 1.2 Environment Variable Updates
**Vercel Dashboard Updates (MANUAL):**
- ✅ Updated AUTH_TOKEN in production environment
- ✅ Updated JWT_SECRET in production environment
- ✅ Updated JWT_REFRESH_SECRET in production environment
- ✅ Updated SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in production environment

**GitHub Actions Secret Updates:**
```bash
gh secret set AUTH_TOKEN --body="[NEW_TOKEN]"
gh secret set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY --body="[NEW_KEY]"
```

### PHASE 2: SYSTEM HARDENING

#### 2.1 Git History Cleanup
```bash
# Used BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove exposed secrets from Git history
bfg --replace-text secrets-to-remove.txt .
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push --force
```

#### 2.2 Security Controls Enhanced
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive secret exclusions
- ✅ Created `.env.example` template with dummy values
- ✅ Added security audit script (`scripts/check-exposed-secrets.ts`)

#### 2.3 GitHub Actions Improvements
Enhanced error handling in all posting workflows:
- ✅ Added proper HTTP status code detection
- ✅ Implemented specific 401 authentication error handling
- ✅ Added detailed failure troubleshooting messages
- ✅ Replaced basic `--fail` with comprehensive response analysis

### PHASE 3: VERIFICATION & MONITORING

#### 3.1 Deployment Verification
```bash
# Created comprehensive verification script
SITE_URL=https://hotdog-diaries.vercel.app AUTH_TOKEN="[TOKEN]" npx tsx scripts/verify-deployment.ts
```
Verification checklist:
- ✅ API endpoint reachability
- ✅ AUTH_TOKEN validity (217 chars vs previous 36 chars)
- ✅ Database connectivity
- ✅ Posting endpoint functionality

#### 3.2 Posting Functionality Restoration
- ✅ Verified AUTH_TOKEN length corrected (217 chars)
- ✅ Confirmed GitHub Actions can authenticate
- ✅ Tested posting endpoint manually
- ✅ Confirmed automated posting schedule restored

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue:** Vercel AUTH_TOKEN was truncated to 36 characters
```
# Before (BROKEN)
AUTH_TOKEN="truncated-invalid-token-36-chars"

# After (FIXED) 
AUTH_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTYyNjI5MTIsImV4cCI6MTc1NjM0OTMxMiwiYXVkIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJpc3MiOiJob3Rkb2ctZGlhcmllcyJ9.X6DzFYj-_2JOoRDMrGPLIOXdDFyn6NqL-T6vgqPc5rY" # 217 chars
```

**Detection Gap:** GitHub Actions workflows showed success despite 401 API responses
- Fixed by implementing proper HTTP status code parsing
- Added explicit authentication failure detection

### Security Improvements Implemented

#### Enhanced Secret Management
1. **Environment Variable Security**
   - All secrets now use proper length validation
   - Comprehensive `.env.example` template created
   - Strict `.gitignore` rules for all environment files

2. **Automated Security Auditing**
   - Created `scripts/check-exposed-secrets.ts` for ongoing monitoring
   - Implemented Git history scanning for secret patterns
   - Added detection for JWT tokens, API keys, and database credentials

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - GitHub Actions workflows now detect and report auth failures
   - Added specific troubleshooting steps for common failures
   - Enhanced logging for deployment verification

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### Test Current AUTH_TOKEN
```bash
# Check token is properly configured (should return 200, not 401)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  "https://hotdog-diaries.vercel.app/api/admin/system-verification"
```

### Verify Posting Functionality
```bash  
# Test posting endpoint works (should succeed, not return "Unauthorized")
curl -X POST "https://hotdog-diaries.vercel.app/api/admin/posting/post-now" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"immediate": true}'
```

### Run Full Deployment Verification
```bash
SITE_URL=https://hotdog-diaries.vercel.app AUTH_TOKEN="$AUTH_TOKEN" \
  npx tsx scripts/verify-deployment.ts
```

## PREVENTION MEASURES

### Immediate Actions Taken
1. **Secret Scanning:** Enabled GitHub secret scanning alerts
2. **Git Hooks:** Implemented pre-commit checks for secrets
3. **Documentation:** Created security incident playbook
4. **Monitoring:** Enhanced error detection in CI/CD pipelines

### Long-term Security Enhancements
1. **Automated Secret Rotation:** Implement scheduled secret rotation
2. **Infrastructure as Code:** Move to managed secret management
3. **Security Training:** Team education on secret management best practices
4. **Regular Audits:** Monthly security audits of repositories and deployments
