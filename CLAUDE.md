# Claude Code Instructions

## Project Context
You are building "Hotdog Diaries" - a website that scans social media for hotdog content and posts it 6 times daily.

## Important Guidelines

### Technology Constraints
- Budget: $0 (use only free tier services)
- Must work on mobile devices
- Clean, minimal design aesthetic

### Development Approach
- Follow prompts in exact order (1-12)
- Complete ALL acceptance criteria before moving to next prompt
- Write comprehensive tests for each component
- Ensure each step integrates with previous work

### Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- Implement proper error handling
- Write clear, documented code
- Follow security best practices

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all functions and components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Test coverage should be comprehensive

### File Organization
- Use consistent folder structure
- Keep components small and focused
- Separate concerns (UI, business logic, data access)
- Use clear, descriptive naming

## Prompt Execution
1. Read entire prompt carefully
2. Implement ALL requirements listed
3. Write ALL specified tests
4. Verify ALL acceptance criteria are met
5. Ensure integration with previous work
6. Document any setup or configuration steps

## When You Need Help
If any requirement is unclear or seems impossible with free tier constraints:
1. Ask for clarification
2. Propose alternative approaches
3. Explain the trade-offs
4. Don't skip requirements without discussion
