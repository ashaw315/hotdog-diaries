## ðŸŽ® **MANUAL TESTING STEPS**

### 1. Desktop Browser Testing
```bash
# Open in browser: http://localhost:3000
# Test each interaction:
# - Scroll with mouse wheel
# - Use arrow keys
# - Click navigation buttons
# - Click progress dots
```

### 2. Mobile Device Testing
```bash
# Open on mobile device or use Chrome DevTools mobile mode
# Test each gesture:
# - Swipe up to go to next post
# - Swipe down to go to previous post
# - Tap progress dots to jump to specific posts
```

### 3. Cross-Browser Testing
- **Chrome**: Full feature support expected
- **Safari**: iOS scrolling behavior, video autoplay
- **Firefox**: Scroll snap support may vary
- **Mobile Safari**: Touch scrolling and video playback

## ðŸš€ **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### **Navigation Flow:**
1. Page loads showing first post full screen
2. User scrolls/swipes to move between posts
3. Each post snaps into perfect full screen view
4. Videos auto-play when active, pause when not
5. Minimal UI overlay doesn't interfere with content

### **Visual Design:**
- **Clean**: White background, minimal chrome
- **Focused**: One post at a time, maximum content space
- **Modern**: TikTok-like interface familiarity
- **Responsive**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes

### **Performance:**
- **Fast**: Smooth 60fps scrolling
- **Efficient**: Videos only play when visible
- **Responsive**: Immediate response to user input
- **Stable**: No crashes or memory issues

## âœ… **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

The TikTok-style feed is successful when:
- Users can navigate smoothly between posts using any input method
- Content displays beautifully at full screen without distortion
- The interface feels familiar and intuitive (like TikTok)
- Performance is smooth on both desktop and mobile devices
- All content types (video, image, text) render properly
- The minimal UI doesn't distract from the content experience

## ðŸ”§ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Common Issues:
- **Scroll not snapping**: Check CSS scroll-snap support in browser
- **Videos not playing**: Autoplay policies may require user interaction first
- **Touch not working**: Ensure touch event handlers are properly bound
- **Content not fitting**: Check aspect ratio and object-fit CSS properties
- **Performance issues**: Monitor for memory leaks in video elements

The feed should feel exactly like scrolling through TikTok - intuitive, smooth, and content-focused!
