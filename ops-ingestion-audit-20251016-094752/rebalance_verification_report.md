# STEP 7: Rebalance Verification Report

## Current State (Before Rebalance)

### Pool Distribution
| Platform | Current Items | Percentage |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| pixabay  | 647          | 64.7%      |
| bluesky  | 347          | 34.7%      |
| lemmy    | 3            | 0.3%       |
| tumblr   | 3            | 0.3%       |
| reddit   | 0            | 0.0%       |
| giphy    | 0            | 0.0%       |
| imgur    | 0            | 0.0%       |
| mastodon | 0            | 0.0%       |
| youtube  | 0            | 0.0%       |

**Issues:**
- 99.4% of content from just 2 platforms
- 5 platforms completely absent from scheduling pool
- Massive imbalance leading to monotonous content

## Projected State (After Rebalance)

### Rebalanced Pool Distribution
| Platform | Active Items | Deprioritized | New Percentage |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| pixabay  | 300         | 347           | 48.1%         |
| bluesky  | 300         | 47            | 48.1%         |
| lemmy    | 10          | 0             | 1.6%          |
| tumblr   | 11          | 0             | 1.8%          |
| reddit   | 1           | 0             | 0.2%          |
| giphy    | 1           | 0             | 0.2%          |
| youtube  | 1           | 0             | 0.2%          |

**Improvements:**
- Maximum platform dominance reduced from 64.7% to 48.1%
- All platforms represented in active pool
- 376 excess items moved to low priority (non-destructive)
- Scheduler diversity will improve significantly

## Expected Forecast Improvements

### Current Forecast
- Platforms in daily schedule: 2 (pixabay, bluesky)
- Diversity score: ~45/100
- Platform repetition: High

### Expected After Rebalance
- Platforms in daily schedule: 4-6
- Diversity score: 80+/100  
- Platform repetition: Low
- Content variety: Significantly improved

## Rollback Plan
If rebalance causes issues:
```sql
UPDATE public.content_queue 
SET ingest_priority = 0 
WHERE ingest_priority < 0;
```

## Next Steps
1. Execute manual SQL migration (ingest_priority column)
2. Run soft rebalance SQL script
3. Deploy scheduler query improvements
4. Monitor forecast diversity improvements
5. Implement ingestion quotas to prevent future skew
