# Branch Protection Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the streamlined branch protection strategy for the Hotdog Diaries project, optimized for solo development while maintaining essential security and quality checks.

## Current Setup

### Protected Branches

- **main**: Primary production branch with streamlined required checks

### Required Status Checks

The following checks are required to pass before merging to `main`:

#### Essential Checks (Blocking)
- **Build**: `build` - Verifies code compiles and builds successfully
- **TypeScript**: `typecheck` - Ensures type safety across the codebase  
- **Unit Tests**: `test` - Validates core functionality with unit test suite
- **Lint**: `lint` - Enforces code quality and style standards
- **GitGuardian**: `security/gitguardian` - Prevents secret leaks and security issues
- **OpenAPI Drift**: `spec-drift` - Ensures API documentation stays current

#### Advisory Checks (Non-blocking)
- **Deployment Gate**: `deployment-gate-result` - Provides deployment validation info
- **Deep Health Checks**: Moved to `prod-watchdog.yml` (scheduled)

## Streamlined CI Philosophy

### What We Keep
1. **Build Safety**: Ensure code compiles and deploys
2. **Type Safety**: Catch TypeScript errors early
3. **Unit Testing**: Validate core logic 
4. **Code Quality**: Maintain consistent style with linting
5. **Security**: Prevent secrets from being committed
6. **API Documentation**: Keep OpenAPI spec current with auto-refresh

### What We Streamlined
1. **Deployment Gates**: Converted to advisory/informational status
2. **Deep Health Checks**: Moved to scheduled monitoring (prod-watchdog.yml)
3. **Admin Endpoint Testing**: Moved to hourly production monitoring
4. **Complex Integration Tests**: Simplified to essential checks only

## Implementation Details

### Required Checks Configuration
```yaml
# In GitHub repository settings > Branches > main > Branch protection rules
required_status_checks:
  strict: true
  checks:
    - "build"
    - "typecheck" 
    - "test"
    - "lint"
    - "security/gitguardian"
    - "spec-drift / detect-api-drift"
```

### Advisory Checks
- **Deployment Gate**: Runs but never blocks merge (always exits 0)
- **Production Monitoring**: Handled by `prod-watchdog.yml` on schedule
- **Health Validation**: Deep checks run hourly, not on every commit

## Rationale

### Why Streamlined?
1. **Solo Project**: Complex deployment gates add friction without team benefit
2. **Fast Iteration**: Essential checks catch real issues without blocking flow
3. **Security First**: GitGuardian prevents actual security problems
4. **Quality Maintained**: Build, TypeScript, tests, and lint ensure code quality
5. **Production Monitoring**: Separate scheduled monitoring for deep validation

### What This Achieves
- ✅ **Faster PR cycles**: Reduced from 15+ minute complex gates to ~5 minute essential checks
- ✅ **Maintained Security**: GitGuardian + secret rotation prevents security issues
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Build + TypeScript + tests + lint catch real problems
- ✅ **API Documentation**: Auto-refresh keeps OpenAPI spec current
- ✅ **Production Monitoring**: Hourly watchdog ensures production health
- ✅ **Developer Experience**: Focus on coding, not fighting CI complexity

## Monitoring Strategy

### Pull Request Checks (Fast)
- Code compiles and builds ✓
- TypeScript types are valid ✓
- Unit tests pass ✓
- Code style is consistent ✓
- No secrets committed ✓
- API docs are current ✓

### Production Monitoring (Scheduled)
- Deep health endpoint validation
- Admin endpoint smoke tests
- Database connectivity checks
- Auth token validation
- Content queue health
- Platform status monitoring

## Usage Guidelines

### For Contributors
1. **Focus on Essential Quality**: Ensure your code builds, types check, tests pass, and lints clean
2. **Security Awareness**: Never commit real secrets (GitGuardian will catch them)
3. **API Changes**: Update OpenAPI spec or add to ignore patterns for drift detection
4. **Advisory Status**: Don't worry about deployment gate warnings - they're informational only

### For Maintainers
1. **Monitor Production**: Check prod-watchdog.yml results for real issues
2. **Review Security**: Investigate any GitGuardian findings thoroughly
3. **API Maintenance**: Review OpenAPI drift reports and auto-refresh commits
4. **Adjust Thresholds**: Update ignore patterns as needed for legitimate endpoints

## Benefits

### Development Velocity
- **Faster feedback**: Essential checks complete in ~5 minutes vs 15+ minutes
- **Reduced friction**: No complex deployment validation blocking PRs
- **Clear expectations**: 6 essential checks that directly impact code quality

### Maintained Quality
- **Security**: GitGuardian prevents secret leaks
- **Reliability**: Build + TypeScript + tests catch breaking changes
- **Consistency**: Linting enforces code style standards
- **Documentation**: Auto-refresh keeps API docs current

### Production Safety
- **Monitoring**: Hourly production health checks
- **Alerting**: Issues create GitHub issues for tracking
- **Validation**: Deep checks run on schedule, not blocking development

## Migration Notes

### From Complex Gates
- Deployment gates converted to advisory status (informational only)
- Deep health checks moved to prod-watchdog.yml (scheduled)
- Admin endpoint testing moved to production monitoring
- Complex integration tests simplified to essential checks

### Benefits Realized
- **PR cycle time**: Reduced from 15+ minutes to ~5 minutes
- **Developer experience**: Focus on code quality, not CI complexity
- **Security maintained**: GitGuardian + rotation strategy
- **Production monitoring**: Proper separation of concerns

## Conclusion

This streamlined approach provides:
1. **Essential quality gates** that catch real issues
2. **Fast feedback loops** for development velocity  
3. **Maintained security** with secret detection
4. **Production monitoring** with appropriate scheduling
5. **Clear separation** between development checks and production validation

The result is a CI system optimized for solo development that maintains quality and security without unnecessary complexity.
