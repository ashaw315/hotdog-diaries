## ⚠️ Areas Needing Attention

### 1. **Testing Infrastructure (Critical)**
**Status:** 🔴 **NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**
- **Test Results:** 41 failed suites, 13 passed (76% failure rate)
- **Failed Tests:** 333 failed, 310 passed
- **Root Cause:** API consolidation broke many test mocks and expectations

```bash
Test Suites: 41 failed, 13 passed, 54 total  
Tests: 333 failed, 310 passed, 643 total
```

**Required Actions:**
1. Update test mocks for consolidated API endpoints
2. Fix database connection mocks in test environment
3. Update test expectations for new API response formats
4. Implement proper test database setup/teardown

### 2. **Content Queue Management**
**Status:** 🟡 **MONITORING REQUIRED**
- **Current Queue:** Only 9 approved items (1.5 days of content)
- **Minimum Threshold:** 5 items (system warning)
- **Recommended:** 30+ items (5+ days of content)
- **Alert Level:** Low (approaching critical)

**Required Actions:**
1. Trigger emergency content scanning across all platforms
2. Lower approval thresholds temporarily for high-confidence content
3. Review and approve pending content manually
4. Investigate why automatic approval isn't keeping up

### 3. **GitHub Actions Workflow Updates**
**Status:** 🟡 **NEEDS UPDATES**
- **Issue:** Many workflows still call deprecated API endpoints
- **Impact:** Workflows may fail due to endpoint changes
- **Example:** Daily report workflow calls `/api/admin/schedule` (now consolidated)

**Required Actions:**
1. Update all workflow files to use consolidated endpoints
2. Test all cron jobs with new API structure
3. Update secrets and authentication for new endpoints

### 4. **Error Monitoring & Logging**
**Status:** 🟡 **NEEDS ENHANCEMENT**
- **Current:** Basic console logging and database logging
- **Missing:** Structured error tracking, alert system, performance monitoring
- **Impact:** Difficult to debug issues in production

**Required Actions:**
1. Implement structured logging with severity levels
2. Add error tracking service (Sentry, LogRocket)
3. Create alert system for critical failures
4. Add performance monitoring for API endpoints
