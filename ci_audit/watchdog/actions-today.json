This prevents duplicate key\nviolations when the scheduler tries to schedule content that was\npreviously posted.\n\nRoot cause: Scheduler only checked scheduled_posts and is_posted flag,\nbut didn't verify against posted_content table. This caused content\nto be scheduled multiple times even after posting.\n\nFixes missed posts on 2025-11-09 where 3 slots failed due to\nduplicate key constraint violations.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>",
