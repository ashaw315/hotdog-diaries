## Methodology

Automated analysis of GitHub Actions workflows, failure logs, and usage patterns using signature-based failure detection and business value assessment.

## Data Limitations

- GitHub Actions run data not available - analysis based on workflow definitions only
- Failure signature analysis not performed - cannot identify specific failure patterns
- Analysis limited to workflows in .github/workflows directory
- Historical data limited to last 50 runs per workflow
- Log analysis may miss certain failure patterns due to log formatting variations
