## 🟠 Short-term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)

### Low-Complexity Consolidations

- **Create composite action for common steps**
  - Benefit: Reduce step duplication, easier maintenance
  - First step: Create new composite action in .github/actions/
- **Create composite action for common steps**
  - Benefit: Reduce step duplication, easier maintenance
  - First step: Create new composite action in .github/actions/
- **Create composite action for common steps**

## 🟡 Long-term Actions (Next Month)

### Workflow Architecture Improvements

- **Merge similar workflows: Post Dinner Content & Post Evening Content**
  - Complexity: medium
  - Impact: Reduce maintenance overhead, consolidate CI/CD logic
- **Merge similar workflows: Post Dinner Content & Post Late Night Content**
  - Complexity: medium
  - Impact: Reduce maintenance overhead, consolidate CI/CD logic
- **Merge similar workflows: Post Dinner Content & Post Lunch Content**
  - Complexity: medium
  - Impact: Reduce maintenance overhead, consolidate CI/CD logic

### Golden Path Implementation

- 📊 Current state: 50 workflows, 14 consolidation opportunities
- 🎯 Target: Reduce to 46 workflows (~8% reduction)
- 🔒 Preserve core workflows: Auto PR CI Shepherd, CI Failure Drilldown (Read-Only), CI Test, CI Test, CI, Deploy Gate, 🚪 Deployment Gate, Meta CI Audit, Phase 3 CI Auto-Healing: Security & Build Diagnostics, Scan Social Platforms, Schedule Reconciliation, 🔥 Weekly Smoke Test

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Target Improvements

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| Security Score | 0/100 | 85+ | 2 weeks |
| Workflow Count | 52 | 48 | 1 month |
| Scheduling Collisions | 17 | <3 | 1 week |
| High-Risk Secrets | 12 | <10 | 2 weeks |

### Monitoring Plan
