## üîÑ Identity Drift Analysis

### Deleted Workflows (3)
- **Legacy CI Pipeline** (ID: 201) - Last seen: 10/19/2025
- **Old Deploy Script** (ID: 202) - Last seen: 10/17/2025
- **CI Pipeline** (ID: 301) - Last seen: 10/17/2025

*These workflows have recent runs but no current workflow file. Consider if their failures are still relevant.*
### Potential Renames (1)
- **CI Pipeline**
  - Current: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (ID: 101)
  - Previous: .github/workflows/ci-old.yml (IDs: 301)

*These workflows may have been moved or renamed. Earlier failures belong to the old workflow IDs.*

## üéØ Workflow Assessment

| Assessment | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| üö® Necessary | 4 | 57.1% |
| ‚úÖ Useful | 1 | 14.3% |
| ‚ôªÔ∏è Redundant | 1 | 14.3% |
| üóëÔ∏è Outdated | 1 | 14.3% |

## üö® High-Failure Workflows

- **Old Content Scanner**: 89% failure rate (outdated)
  - Issues: PERMISSION, MISSING_SECRET, OUTDATED
  - Rationale: Consistently failing (89% failure rate) - likely outdated

- **Content Scanner - Reddit**: 65% failure rate (redundant)
  - Issues: MISSING_SECRET, PERMISSION
  - Rationale: Content workflow with permission issues - may be superseded

## üîç Most Common Failure Patterns

- **AUTH_TOKEN_POLICY**: 2 occurrences
- **MISSING_SECRET**: 1 occurrences
- **HEALTH_CHECK**: 1 occurrences
- **PERMISSION**: 1 occurrences

## üéØ Priority Actions

### Immediate (Next Sprint)


### Near-term (Next Month)
