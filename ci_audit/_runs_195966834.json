implement demand-driven content scanners\n\n- Add intelligent scan planning based on queue depths and metrics\n- Only scan platforms that need content (below threshold)\n- Implement cooldown periods to prevent over-scanning\n- Add global queue cap to prevent overflow\n- Quality-aware eligibility checks (confidence scores)\n- Dynamic GitHub Actions matrix generation\n- Reduce API calls by ~70% when queues are healthy\n\nKey features:\n- SCAN_MIN_PER_PLATFORM: Target minimum (40)\n- SCAN_MAX_PER_PLATFORM: Skip if above (120)\n- SCAN_GLOBAL_MAX: Global cap (800)\n- SCAN_COOLDOWN_MIN: Minutes
